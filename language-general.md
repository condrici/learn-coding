# Programming Languages: General

## Interpreted vs. Compiled Languages

### Workflow

Interpreted: 
- [1] Write code
- [2] The interpreter runs the code as is
- [3] You share your code as is (code is public) so others can run it, but they need the same interpreter

Compiled: 
- [1] Write the code
- [2] Compiler converts your code into an executable file that contains machine code (binary code)
- [3] You share the executable file (code is not public) so others can immediately run it

Compiled Steps:
- [1] Pre-processing
- [2] Compiling, 
- [3] Assembling
- [4] Linking

### Tools

Compiler Tools:
- Debugger: step through the program assembly interactively.
- Disassembler: view the program assembly in more detail.
- Decompiler, turn a program back into partial source code (assuming you know what it was written in)

### Examples
Interpreted: PHP, JavaScript \
Compiled: GoLang \
Hybrid: VisualBasic, C# (C Sharp), Java, Kotlin, Python, Swift 

### Pros
Interpreted: 
- Portable
- Easier to debug because you have access to the entire source code

Compiled:
- One executable file written in machine code
- Faster to run
- Optimized for the hardware it runs on
- Source code is private

### Cons
Interpreted: 
- Machine running code requires interpreter
- Slower
- Source code is public

Compiled: 
- Not cross-platform
- Initial compilation takes time

## Examples of Programming Languages

### Python
Type: Interpreted and Compiled \
Level: High level

### JavaScript (ECMAScript 5)
Type: Interpreted \
Level: High level 

### PHP
Type: Interpreted \
Level: High level

### GoLang
Type: Compiled \
Level: High level (still it is considered a systems programming language)
